- Task-03: Write a program that converts hryvnias into dollars. The following should appear as a result:  
*Example:* 1500 hryvnias redeemable for $51.
- Task-04: Write a program that simulates rolling a dice.
- Task-05: Write a game program with 2 cubes. A person and a robot throw 2 dice each, and the one whose sum of numbers is greater wins (if the same - friendship wins). That is, the person got 6 + 6, that's 12, the robot got 1 + 3 = 4, the person won. If a person and a robot got a double (same numbers on both dice), then this is a great luck, a draw and there is no point in playing further.
- Task-06: A three-digit number is given. Find:
1. The sum of its digits.
2. Find the number obtained by writing out the digits of the given three-digit natural number in reverse order.
3. Rearrange the numbers so that the new number is the largest possible.
